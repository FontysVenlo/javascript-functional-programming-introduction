# Functional programming with Javascript - Introduction
<!-- .slide: data-background="images/slides-headline-background.jpg" -->

This introduction course is part of a course called PPAR - Programming Paradigms of Fontys University of Applied Sciences. The idea of PPAR is to let students in higher semesters experience differnt programming paradigms - thus experience what the pros and cons are.
This part covers the functional programming paradigm. For this course was javascript chosen. The reason for that is, that javascript is not only a popular but also a modern programming language. Students can and will use this language also in multiple course - so following this course will improve the programming skills with javascript.

## Organisational

### Purpose

The purpose of this workshop as part of the PPAR course is to give a brief introduction of functional programming with javascript by quickly **doing it**!
We will use ES6+ as well as node.js for this course.

<!-- s -->


### The main learning goals

- Get familiar with Haskell language and its compiler
- Know what this functional programming language is and what the benefits of using it are
- Know and use some basic syntax of haskell
- Being able to create small haskell programs

<!-- s -->

### Course structure

The course is structured for 4 lecturing units where either short lecture or practical work on assignments will take place.

<!-- s -->

### Assignments

There will be **one** main Assignment which must be delivered into an individual Github repository provided by github classroom.

The invitation link to this assignments will be send during the lecture via mail and as channel-message.

**NOTE** you have to do all as *mandatory* marked assignments, *doing means pushed into your individual github repository*, in order to pass the Haskell part of this course.
